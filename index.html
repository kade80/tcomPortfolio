<h1>Jaxon Prouse</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am Jaxon Prouse, a Computer Systems Technology student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic.<br>
    From a young age I have always been technology and the amazing things humans are able to accomplish with it.<br>
    I love the problem-solving opportunities that programing gives.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I would like to develop products that help people and that they can use in their everyday life.<br>
    I am seeking a job in software development or IT support.</p>
<h2>Skills and Abilities</h2>
<p>My education in the Computer Systems Technology program has given me experience with many different technologies.<br>
    I have learned about IT support, operating systems, networking and especially programming.
    I have extensively studied programming data structures and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.<br>
    In the summer of 2024 I interned with the IT department of the Lanigan site. This gave real world experience in the industry.</p>

<p>I have done many hours for work with Canvas API, I way to draw and animate with pure JavaScript.<br>
    In this example we see a man holding a stick. This was painstakingly drawn line by line by me with code.<br>
    Canvas API allows you to display things on the screen by letting you draw two things: rectangles and paths.<br>
    I found this to a good exercise in Object Oriented Programing, as while as being fun.</p>

<h2>Hippotherapy Project</h2>
<p>This project was done as part of my COSA and CPMG classes at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, where me and my team developed an application for an external client.<br>
    Our application was made to keep track of patients undergoing equine therapy, which is essentially using horseback riding to correct a patient's severely misshapen posture.<br>
    This project used Flutter, Firebase and ASP.NET. It taught me about project management, the test driven development process as well as mobile first frontend development and backend APIs.<br>
    The things I am proudest of from this project is completing the authorization for this app, which greatly increased the app's security <br>
    and I was able to send emails when users signed up so we could ensure all users had valid emails.<br></p>

<h2>Roll to Mathematically Cause Chaos</h2>
<p>Me and a partner created a website that allowed users to create and organize characters for Table Top Role Playing Games,<br>
specifically the game Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. It allowed you to enter attributes of your character and then save that character to our backend database.<br>
There was also a feature that allowed you to calculate the damage per round a character would do against an enemy based on the characters attributes and how strong of an enemy they are facing.<br>
    This project used Vue for the frontend and Typescript for the backend.<br></p>
